## 🚀 How It Works

- Each section of the menu is a separate HTML page.
- The language switcher uses `localStorage` to remember the user's preference.
- The `lang.js` file stores translations, and `modal.js` applies them dynamically on each page.
- Everything is statically hosted – no server or database needed.
